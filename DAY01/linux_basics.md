## 🔍 1.Searching for `{error code 500}` in Linux – Interview Story

Imagine I'm in a system administrator or DevOps interview, and the interviewer asks:

> **"How would you search for the string `{error code 500}` in your Linux logs?"**

Instead of just jumping into a command, I like to give a brief story that reflects my experience and thought process.

---

### 🎯 The Scenario

*"A few months ago, I was on-call during a deployment for one of our production applications. Suddenly, alerts started firing — users were getting server errors, and the backend logs were our best bet to diagnose the issue fast."*

---

### 🛠️ The Problem

We suspected a server-side issue, particularly HTTP 500 errors — which usually mean something went wrong on our side. Our logs were extensive, so scanning manually wasn’t an option.

---

### 💡 The Solution – Using `grep`

To locate the issue quickly, I ran a command like this:

```bash
grep -R '{error code 500}' /var/log/
```

* `grep` is used for searching plain-text files for lines that match a pattern.
* `-R` makes it recursive, scanning all files and subdirectories.
* `'/var/log/'` is the default system log directory.

---

### ⏱️ Improving Search Performance

If I knew the exact log file — say `app.log` — I’d do:

```bash
grep '{error code 500}' /var/log/app.log
```

To add context (lines before and after the match), I’d use:

```bash
grep -C 3 '{error code 500}' /var/log/app.log
```

Or just lines **after** the match:

```bash
grep -A 5 '{error code 500}' /var/log/app.log
```

---

### 🔄 Bonus: Live Monitoring with `tail`

To monitor this in real-time for future incidents, I’d use:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/app.log | grep '{error code 500}'
```

This allows me to watch the log live and filter for just the error lines.

---

### ✅ The Outcome

*"Within minutes, we found that a third-party API failure was causing unhandled exceptions. After wrapping that call with error handling and deploying a hotfix, errors stopped, and the system stabilized."*

It was a high-pressure moment, but having the right tools and mindset helped resolve the issue quickly.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* Use `grep` for quick, flexible log searching.
* Add `-C`, `-A`, or `-B` for context.
* Combine with `tail -f` for real-time monitoring.
* Always validate the path and permissions for log files.

## 🧠 2.Interview Question

> **"How would you view the last 40 lines of a log file in Linux?"**

Rather than just quoting the command, I like to share a quick story that shows real-world experience, decision-making, and technical knowledge.

---

## 🎯 The Scenario

_"During a post-deployment validation phase, we were troubleshooting an issue where users intermittently received blank pages. The logs were our primary source of truth."_  

However, the log file (`/var/log/myapp/server.log`) was **massive** — hundreds of thousands of lines long. We didn’t need everything — just the most recent activity.

---

## 🛠️ The Solution – Using `tail`

To quickly see what happened **most recently**, I ran:

```bash
tail -n 40 /var/log/myapp/server.log
````

### 🔍 Explanation:

* `tail` is a Linux command used to display the end of a file.
* `-n 40` tells it to show the **last 40 lines**.
* This is perfect for recent logs, especially after a restart or a suspected crash.

---

## 🚀 Why 40 Lines?

In my experience, the default `tail` output (`tail filename` gives 10 lines) is often too short to provide enough context.
40 lines strike a good balance — not overwhelming, but usually enough to spot trends, repeated errors, or key timestamps.

---

## ⏱️ Bonus Tip – Real-time Monitoring

If I needed to **monitor logs live**, I’d use:

```bash
tail -n 40 -f /var/log/myapp/server.log
```

* The `-f` flag **follows** the file, so as new lines are written, they appear instantly in the terminal.
* Useful when reproducing an issue or watching system behavior during load.

---

## ✅ The Outcome

*"By using `tail -n 40`, we instantly saw recent exceptions pointing to a missing environment variable. We patched the config, restarted the service, and the issue was resolved without digging through gigabytes of log data."*

The ability to quickly extract just what you need from logs is critical in live environments.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* `tail -n 40 [file]` shows the last 40 lines — ideal for fast debugging.
* Combine with `-f` for real-time log following.
* Useful in deployment verification, crash diagnosis, and system monitoring.

---

## 📌 Summary Command

```bash
tail -n 40 /var/log/myapp/server.log
```

or, for live tracking:

```bash
tail -n 40 -f /var/log/myapp/server.log
```

## 🎙️ 3.Interview Scenario

**Interviewer:** Your Linux server shows that 80% of disk (ROM) is used. How would you troubleshoot which directories or files are consuming the most space?

**Me:** Great question! Here's how I approach this problem step by step, using a mix of Linux commands like `df`, `du`, and `find` to get detailed visibility.

---

## 📍 Step 1: Check Overall Disk Usage – `df`

First, I check the **overall disk usage** using the `df` command:

```bash
df -h
````

* The `-h` flag gives human-readable output (e.g., GB/MB).
* This tells me **which mount points or partitions are full**.
* Usually, I focus on `/` or `/home` or `/var`, as they tend to fill up fastest.

> ✅ Example output:
>
> ```
> Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
> /dev/sda1        50G   40G   10G  80% /
> ```

This tells me the root (`/`) partition is 80% full.

---

## 📍 Step 2: Identify Large Directories – `du`

Now that I know the root is filling up, I use `du` to see **which subdirectories are taking the most space**.

```bash
sudo du -sh /* 2>/dev/null
```

* `-s`: summary only
* `-h`: human-readable
* `2>/dev/null`: suppress permission denied errors

> ✅ Sample output:
>
> ```
> 4.1G    /var
> 12G     /home
> 18G     /opt
> 1.2G    /usr
> ```

Let’s say `/opt` is the largest—then I’ll dive deeper into it.

---

## 📍 Step 3: Drill Down into Subdirectories

To explore `/opt` recursively:

```bash
sudo du -h /opt | sort -hr | head -n 20
```

* This shows the **top 20 biggest directories/files** inside `/opt`, sorted by size.

> ✅ This helps narrow down specific folders like `/opt/app/logs` or `/opt/backups`.

---

## 📍 Step 4: Find Large Files – `find`

To locate the **largest files** on the system:

```bash
sudo find / -type f -size +100M -exec ls -lh {} \; 2>/dev/null | sort -k 5 -rh | head -n 10
```

* This shows files over 100MB, sorted by size.
* Helps find backups, logs, ISOs, or core dumps that can be archived or deleted.

---

## 📍 Step 5: Special Focus – `/var/log`, `/tmp`, `/home`, `/opt`

Some common culprits:

* **`/var/log`**: old log files (check `journalctl`, `.gz` or `.1` files)
* **`/tmp`**: temporary files not cleaned up
* **`/home`**: user files, downloads, and backups
* **`/opt`**: third-party apps or installers

Commands to clean:

```bash
sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=100M
sudo rm -rf /tmp/*
```

---

## 📍 Step 6: Optional – Use Tools for Easier Analysis

Tools like:

* `ncdu`: visual terminal-based disk usage analyzer
* `baobab`: graphical tool (on desktop)
* `ls -lhS`: list large files in a directory

---

## ✅ Final Actions

Once large files or unused backups are identified:

* Compress or delete old logs
* Move large files to cloud or external storage
* Automate cleanup scripts for `/tmp` and logs

---

## 🧼 Bonus: Setup Alerts

To prevent future issues:

* Setup monitoring with `cron` + email
* Use tools like **Prometheus + Grafana**, **Nagios**, or **CloudWatch** (if on cloud)

# 📁 5.How to Find Large Files in a Directory (Linux `find` Command)

## 🎙️ Interview Scenario

**Interviewer:** Let's say a directory is consuming too much disk space. How would you identify which files are taking up the most memory?

**Me:** That's a great question! If I suspect that a specific directory is filling up the disk, I’d use a combination of Linux commands—especially the powerful `find` command—to locate large files and take action. Here's my step-by-step approach:

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step: Finding Large Files Using `find`

Let’s assume the problematic directory is `/var`.

### 🧪 Step 1: Basic Find Command for Large Files

```bash
sudo find /var -type f -size +100M
````

**Explanation:**

* `find`: Command to search for files
* `/var`: Starting directory
* `-type f`: Look for files (not directories)
* `-size +100M`: Find files **larger than 100 MB**

This gives a list of **absolute paths** to large files, but it’s hard to tell which ones are *biggest*.

---

### 📏 Step 2: List with Human-Readable Sizes

To display file sizes in a readable format:

```bash
sudo find /var -type f -size +100M -exec ls -lh {} \;
```

* `-exec ls -lh {} \;`: For each file found, run `ls -lh` to list details like size, permissions, and date.

---

### 🧹 Step 3: Sort by Size and Display Top 10

Now I’ll sort by size to find the **largest offenders**:

```bash
sudo find /var -type f -size +50M -exec ls -lh {} \; 2>/dev/null | sort -k 5 -hr | head -n 10
```

**Explanation:**

* `sort -k 5 -hr`: Sorts output by the **5th column** (file size) in **human-readable** form, **reverse order** (largest first)
* `head -n 10`: Show **top 10** biggest files

> ✅ Result: A clean, sorted list of the top large files in `/var`

---

## 💡 Example Output

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.2G Sep  3 10:00 /var/log/syslog.1
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 980M Sep  2 22:30 /var/log/journal/xyz.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 700M Sep  1 13:45 /var/tmp/cache.dump
```

---

## 🧯 Step 4: Take Action (Safely!)

Once I know which files are the culprits, I can:

* **Delete** unnecessary files:

  ```bash
  sudo rm /var/tmp/cache.dump
  ```

* **Compress** logs:

  ```bash
  sudo gzip /var/log/syslog.1
  ```

* **Archive or move** to external storage/cloud

---

## ✅ Bonus: Use `ncdu` for Interactive Analysis

For an interactive tool:

```bash
sudo apt install ncdu
sudo ncdu /var
```

It gives a **tree view** of directory sizes and lets you delete files from the UI.

# 🔗 7.Hard Links vs Soft Links (Symbolic Links) – Interview Story

## 🎙️ Interview Scenario

**Interviewer:** Can you explain the difference between hard links and soft links in Linux? Also, where would you typically use each?

**Me:** Absolutely! Understanding hard and soft links is essential for effective file management in Linux. Let me explain both concepts clearly and give examples of when and why I use them.

---

## 🧩 What is a Hard Link?

- A **hard link** is essentially another directory entry that points to the same inode (the actual data on disk) as the original file.
- Both the original file and the hard link share the **same inode number**.
- Deleting one hard link **does not delete the data** as long as another hard link exists.
- Hard links **cannot span across different filesystems** (partitions).
- Hard links **cannot be created for directories** to avoid loops in the filesystem.

---

### 🔨 How to create a hard link?

```bash
ln original_file.txt hardlink_file.txt
````

Both `original_file.txt` and `hardlink_file.txt` point to the **same data**.

---

### 🔎 How do I know it’s a hard link?

Using `ls -li` lists files with their inode numbers:

```bash
ls -li original_file.txt hardlink_file.txt
```

If the inode numbers are the same, they’re hard links.

---

## 🧩 What is a Soft Link (Symbolic Link)?

* A **soft link** (or symbolic link) is a special type of file that points to the pathname of another file or directory.
* It acts like a **shortcut**.
* Unlike hard links, soft links can point to files or directories **across different filesystems**.
* If the target file is deleted, the soft link becomes **broken (dangling)** and points to nowhere.
* Soft links have **different inode numbers** from the target.

---

### 🔨 How to create a soft link?

```bash
ln -s /path/to/original_file.txt softlink_file.txt
```

---

### 🔎 How do I identify a soft link?

Using `ls -l`:

```bash
ls -l softlink_file.txt
```

You'll see an arrow showing where the link points:

```
softlink_file.txt -> /path/to/original_file.txt
```

---

## 🛠️ Where and When I Use Hard Links vs Soft Links

### Hard Links:

* Useful when I want **multiple directory entries** to point to the **same file data** without duplication.
* Commonly used in backup systems or version control where space efficiency matters.
* Good when working on the **same filesystem** and want file duplication without extra storage.

### Soft Links:

* I use soft links for **convenience and flexibility**:

  * Linking configuration files (e.g., `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` to `/etc/nginx/sites-available`)
  * Creating shortcuts to binaries or scripts in `/usr/local/bin` for easy execution.
  * Linking files or directories across different partitions or filesystems.
* Soft links help with **modular setups** where targets may move or be replaced.

---

## ⚠️ Important Differences Summary

| Feature                | Hard Link                           | Soft Link (Symbolic Link)    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Points to              | Same inode (file data)              | Pathname of the target       |
| Can cross filesystems? | No                                  | Yes                          |
| Can link directories?  | No                                  | Yes                          |
| If target deleted?     | Data still accessible via hard link | Link becomes broken/dangling |
| Inode numbers          | Same                                | Different                    |
