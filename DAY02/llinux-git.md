# 🚀 1. Moving Changes to Local Git Repository Without Staging Area – Interview Story

## 🎙️ Interview Scenario

**Interviewer:** Is it possible to move your working changes directly to the local Git repository without using the staging area? How does Git handle this, and what are the implications?

**Me:** That’s a great question! Git’s workflow involves three main areas:

1. **Working Directory** – where you make changes to files.
2. **Staging Area (Index)** – where you prepare changes for commit.
3. **Local Repository** – where commits are stored.

By default, the staging area acts as a **middleman** between your working directory and the commit history.

---

## 🔍 Can You Commit Without Staging?

Technically, **no**, you cannot commit changes directly from the working directory to the local repository **without staging** in the traditional Git flow. However, Git provides ways to simplify this process.

---

## 🛠️ Options to Bypass Explicit Staging

### 1. Use `git commit -a`

The `-a` flag automatically stages all **tracked files** that have been modified or deleted **before committing**, skipping the manual `git add` step for those files.

```bash
git commit -a -m "Commit message"
````

* It **does not include new untracked files**; you still need to `git add` those explicitly.
* This effectively **combines staging and committing** for tracked files.

---

### 2. Use `git commit -am`

Shortcut for the above:

```bash
git commit -am "Commit message"
```

---

### 3. Using `git commit` Without Staging New Files

If you have new files (untracked), you must still stage them explicitly:

```bash
git add newfile.txt
git commit -m "Add new file"
```

---

## ⚠️ Why Does Git Use a Staging Area?

* **Selective commits**: Staging allows you to decide exactly which changes to include.
* **Granularity**: You can prepare complex commits by adding files or parts of files incrementally.
* **Review**: Staging is a checkpoint to review what will be committed.

Skipping staging is possible only for **modified tracked files**, and it’s done for convenience, not to skip the concept of staging entirely.

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts (Interview Closer)

While you cannot *completely* bypass the staging area for **all** changes, Git offers the `-a` flag to implicitly stage tracked changes during commit. This is very handy for quick commits of all modifications without manually staging each one.

> *“The staging area is a powerful feature that gives you control and flexibility over your commits—but Git also lets you streamline the process when you want to.”*

# 🌱 2. What I Know About Git – Interview Story

## 🎙️ Interview Scenario

**Interviewer:** Can you tell me what you know about Git and how you use it in your work?

**Me:** Certainly! Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that helps developers track changes in source code during software development. It’s a fundamental tool in modern DevOps and development workflows.

---

## 🔑 Core Concepts of Git

### 1. **Repositories**

- **Local Repository:** Your personal copy of the entire project, including full history.
- **Remote Repository:** A shared repository, usually hosted on services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

### 2. **Commits**

- Snapshots of your project at specific points in time.
- Each commit has a unique SHA-1 hash.
- Commits include metadata like author, date, and message.

### 3. **Branches**

- Branches allow parallel development.
- The default branch is usually `main` or `master`.
- Feature branches isolate new development work until ready.

### 4. **Staging Area (Index)**

- An intermediate area to prepare commits.
- You can selectively stage changes using `git add`.

## 📈 Advanced Git Concepts

- **Rebasing (`git rebase`):** Reapply commits on top of another base tip, for cleaner history.
- **Cherry-pick:** Apply individual commits from another branch.
- **Tagging:** Mark specific points in history as releases.
- **Stashing (`git stash`):** Temporarily save uncommitted changes.
- **Hooks:** Automate actions on Git events (e.g., pre-commit hooks).

---

## 👨‍💻 Typical Git Workflow I Follow

1. **Clone** the remote repo.
2. **Create a new branch** for a feature or bug fix.
3. Make changes, and **stage** files (`git add`).
4. **Commit** with clear messages (`git commit`).
5. **Push** branch to remote (`git push`).
6. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** for review.
7. After approval, **merge** PR into main branch.
8. **Delete** feature branch locally and remotely.
9. **Pull** latest changes regularly (`git pull`).

## 🧠 3. Interview Question

> **"Suppose on your production Linux server, you accidentally replaced the number `84` with `80` only in 40 places, but there are actually 84 places in total to be replaced. How would you update all 84 locations correctly?"**

---

## 🎯 The Scenario

_"I once had a situation where a quick `sed` replacement command was run on a config file in production. Unfortunately, the command was incomplete or had a limit on how many replacements it did, and only 40 occurrences were updated instead of all 84."_

This partial update caused inconsistencies, leading to subtle bugs in the system.

---

## 🛠️ The Problem

The original command might have been something like:

```bash
sed -i 's/84/80/40' filename
````

Here, the trailing `40` **does not limit replacements** in `sed` by default, but if someone used a custom script or made a mistake, only 40 replacements happened.

Or they ran a command that stopped early.

---

## 💡 The Correct Approach

To replace **all** occurrences of `80` back to `84` (undoing the partial replacement), I would:

1. Make sure to backup the file first:

```bash
cp filename filename.bak
```

2. Use `sed` to replace **all** `80` occurrences with `84` globally:

```bash
sed -i 's/80/84/g' filename
```

* `-i` means edit file in place.
* `s/80/84/g` means substitute all (`g`lobal) `80` with `84`.

---

## 🔍 Verifying the Change

To confirm the fix, I’d count occurrences:

```bash
grep -o '84' filename | wc -l
```

This should return `84`, confirming all locations are corrected.

---

## ⏱️ Bonus: Confirm No `80` Left (If Only Numbers Expected)

```bash
grep -q '80' filename && echo "Still contains 80" || echo "All 80 replaced"
```

---

## ✅ The Outcome

*"By carefully using `sed` with the global flag and verifying with `grep`, I ensured that all 84 locations were corrected without missing any. This prevented potential system failures caused by inconsistent config values."*

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* Always **backup files** before bulk edits.
* Use `sed -i 's/old/new/g' filename` to replace **all** occurrences.
* Verify replacements with `grep` and `wc -l`.
* Partial replacements usually mean the command was misused or limited — double-check flags and syntax.

---

## 📌 Summary Command

```bash
cp filename filename.bak
sed -i 's/80/84/g' filename
grep -o '84' filename | wc -l
```
```

# 🐚 4.Understanding `$0`, `$1`, and `$?` in Shell Scripting – Interview Story

## 🎙️ Interview Scenario

**Interviewer:** Can you explain what `$0`, `$1`, and `$?` represent in shell scripting? How and where do you use them?

**Me:** Sure! These are special shell variables that are very useful when writing and debugging shell scripts. Let me explain each one with examples and practical use cases.

---

## 🔍 What Does `$0` Mean?

- `$0` represents the **name of the script** or the command being executed.
- It’s useful for printing the script name, for example, in help messages or logs.

### Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "This script name is: $0"
````

If the script is named `myscript.sh`, running it would output:

```
This script name is: ./myscript.sh
```

---

## 🔍 What Does `$1` Mean?

* `$1` is the **first positional parameter** or argument passed to the script or function.
* `$2`, `$3`, etc., represent the second, third, and so forth arguments.
* Used to accept input from users when running the script.

### Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "First argument is: $1"
```

Run with:

```bash
./myscript.sh hello
```

Output:

```
First argument is: hello
```

---

## 🔍 What Does `$?` Mean?

* `$?` stores the **exit status of the last executed command**.
* By convention, an exit status of `0` means success; any non-zero value indicates an error.
* Very useful for error checking and conditional execution in scripts.

### Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
ls /some/directory
echo "Exit status of ls command: $?"
```

If `/some/directory` exists, you might get:

```
Exit status of ls command: 0
```

If it doesn’t exist:

```
ls: cannot access '/some/directory': No such file or directory
Exit status of ls command: 2
```

---

## 🛠️ Practical Usage in Scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$#" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <filename>"
  exit 1
fi

filename=$1

if [ -f "$filename" ]; then
  echo "File $filename exists."
else
  echo "File $filename does not exist."
fi

# Check last command status
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Script executed successfully."
else
  echo "An error occurred."
fi
```
